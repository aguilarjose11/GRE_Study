Jose's Graduate Record Examinations Study
=========================================

Hi! This repo will contain my work as I study for the GRE. You see, I am hoping to enter a top-tier Research institution to pursue a Ph.D in Computer Science focused towards AI -> SNNs. Being the organization freak I am--and the fact that maybe admissions officials may see this--, I decided to create a repo where I will keep notes, facts, and some materials.  If you are someone also studying for the GRE, be welcome to browse my notes. I do warn in advance that these materials will be focused for my own personal use, and I may not always have notes that may be the most external-reader friendly. Do feel free to shoot me an email and I could help you study for the GRE! Finally, I note that all the materials will be an inspiration from copyrighted books and resources. All rights go to the respective authors. I do not take any responsibility forany negative effects these notes may cause in your own studies, that if you intend to use these materails for your own study. Remember that I am studying too; hence, I am no professional GRE coach. I hope to help others in their GRE adventure by providing useful notes and techniques. 

With all of that said, I extend to you, dear github astronaut, a warm welcome to my **dojo.** 


Organization
------------

This repo will follow the same organizational structure as my other repos: 

- There will be a **Main branch** that will contain all of my completed work. This will include completed study notes and any materials I may create for myself.

- The **develop branch** will contain notes and materials that may be partially completed. You will be able to see my latest completed notes here. 

- The _develop sub-branches_ will follow the naming convention where the branch name identifies a certain study aspect that I may be currently engaged in. You can see my latest progress here. Do be mindful that notes and materials here are assumed to be incomplete and may change at any point of time. Any sub-branches from the sub-branches may represent specific topics I am combing through.


Materials
---------

I will warn beforehand that I **will not** keep any official study materials here--and I mean books by that. Instead, I will list them and provide some insight into each that you could find useful.

Jose's Plan of Attack
---------------------

I plan on taking the September GRE test. Currently, I started studying for it in the middle of february. This gives me almost 6 months. You do not need this much time to prepare. The luxury of time is a rarity, and I admit that if you can gain time, do it. Most people I know have prepared for the GRE and obtained **top** scores by studying under 3 months. The more time the better, and I do recomend leaving some time to be able to retake the GRE if necesary. I am planning on graduating college with my bachelors in the Fall of 2022, but I will attend my same university (the University of Oklahoma) for an additional year to complete my masters in Computer Science. This gives me the oportunity to prepare more, but I believe that 3 months can be more than enough to study. If you are in a pickle and have less than 1.5 months, go to reddit and look for month-long GRE prep. There are ton of prep schedules where you will pretty much be a monk, but will earn you a high score.

This is my plan of attack for the GRE:


### Acommodation Stage (first 3 months Feb 12 - May 12)

My main focus here is to get accustomed to the idea of the GRE. I will read the Test-taking information to understand how the GRE even works. I will start reviewing straight from the official guide and build my basics. 

The acquisition of vocab will be especially important here, for it is known to take a bit. Equally vital will be reading scientific literature to build my reading comprehension for the type of questions in the GRE.

Towards the end of the stage, I will take my first [GRE test(PowerPrep1)](https://www.gregmat.com/practice-tests) to see how I do. Based on these results is how I will approach the next stage.


### Study Stage (2 months May 13 - July 13)

The study stage is where I will begin more serious studying. Based on the results gathered from the GRE practice test I should have taken towards the end of phase one, I will study to strengthen these areas. I will Use Magoosh To further gain experience within the weak places and gain better skills for test-taking. It will be vital for me to close any gaps in knowledge here and gain as many test practice skills.

Two practice tests will be taken here. I will take both online tests at this point to further move my studying to better fit my requirements. The first test shall take place around June 13, and the second on July 13


### Final Stretch Stage (1 Month July 14 - August 14)

The goal of this stage is to focus on the test-taking skills and the skills required for fast testing. I should have proficiency in the areas for the GRE, and now I shall make sure I can get the most points. A test will take place around August 1st where I will check my progress. I should continue to take practice problems and find practice tests wherever I can find them.

### Pre-Testing period

For the pre-testing period, I will focus on doing leg work to get as many practice problems as possible. I will take my final paper practice test a week before the official test date.
