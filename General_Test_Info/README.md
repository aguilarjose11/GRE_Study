Chapter 1: About the GRE General Test
======================================

from the Official Guide to the GRE General Test.


Introduction
------------

Pourpose: _To measure verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, critical thinking, and analytical writing skills._

Basically, the GRE is used by everyone that deals with admissions, money for grad school, and fellowships. a good score can help you survive the "filtering phase" of admissions, but do be wary that most of the time the GRE will almost never guarantee acceptance. Your profile is what really matters.

Structure of the Test
----------------------

There are **three** parts to the GRE:

### Analytical Writing

There are 4 very important things being tested for:

1. Ability to articulate and support complex ideas.
  - See more in the Analytical Writing's Analyze and Issue task.

2. Examine claims and accompanying evidence.
  - See more in the Analytical Writing's Analyze an argument task.

3. Sustain focused and coherent discussion.
  - The GRE graders will be looking closely that you actually do what the instructions say. This sounds easy, but in reality this is a commong mistake done by test takers. Focus on the prompt. Do not bring your own opinions. Remain focused in the analysis and remember: They are looking to see whether your critical thinking skills are pollished
4. Control over elements of standard english.
  - Needless to say, in grad school, regardless of your path, you will need to comunicate efficiently. This requires good usage of elements of english. Do note that a few minor grammar mistakes can still earn you a max score, but don't commit too many of them or severe ones.

### Verbal Reasoning

There are 3 very important things you will be tested for:

1. Ability to analyze and evaluate writen material.
2. Ability to syntesize infromation from read material.
3. Ability to understand words, sentences, and entire texts.
4. Ability to make connections and relationships among words and concepts.

Basically, how well can you understand what you read and your skills when putting that information to work, per se.

1. Basic mathematical skills.
2. Understanding of the following:

  - Arithmetic.
  - Algebra.
  - Geometry.
  - Data Analysis.


### GRE Test structure

The GRE is unique in that the test is adaptive. Each part is composed of two sections. The GRE being dynamic means that the GRE adapts its difficulty based on the previous questions you answered on the first section. **This is what can make the GRE hard.** Focusing on studying for the GRE to fulfill the target skillsets the test makers are hoping to see is crucial.

The organization of the test is so that the Analytical Writing part will always come first. Then, Verbal and Quantitative Reasning sections, alongside the Unscored section, may apear in any order.

For the quantitative section, an ETS calculator will be provided.

There are 2 types of GRE. The online version and the paper version. The time and number of questions is somewhat different as well as the prescence of the Unscored and Research sections (more on this later).

#### Online GRE

The Online GRE takes about **3 Hours and 45 Minutes**. This includes a _10 minute_ break after the third section and _1 minute_ breaks after each section.

| Measure | Number of Questions | Allotted Time |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| **Analytical Writing** </br> (One section for both essays)| Two: Analyze and _Issue_ and _Argument_ essays| 30 minutes for each essay</br>(1 hour)|
| **Verbal Reasoning** </br> (Two Sections) | 20 questions per section | 30 minutes per section </br> (1 hour) |
| **Quantitative Reasoning** </br> (Two Sections) | 20 questions per section | 35 minutes per section </br> (1 hour 10 minutes) |
| **Unscored** | 20 questions | Varies |
| **Research** </br> (Always at the end) | Depends | Varies |

Both the Unscored and Research sections are only for question-testing and ETS reseach pourposes. The Unscored Section may apear at any point after the Analytical writing part. Because of this, and the fact that is unidentified, treat the section as if it were the real section. Scores for these questions will not affect your score.

#### Paper GRE

The paper GRE takes 3 hours and 30 minutes with only a single 10 minute break after the end of the analytical writing section. The Unscored and Research parts are not included.

| Measure | Number of Questions | Allotted Time |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| **Analytical Writing** </br> (One section for both essays)| Two: Analyze and _Issue_ and _Argument_ essays| 30 minutes for each essay</br>(1 hour)|
| **Verbal Reasoning** </br> (Two Sections) | 25 questions per section | 35 minutes per section </br> (1 hour 10 minutes) |
| **Quantitative Reasoning** </br> (Two Sections) | 25 questions per section | 40 minutes per section </br> (1 hour 20 minutes) |

### Test Taking Tips

#### Writing Section

* Budget your time
* Think about the topic throughly
* Remind yourself of the question instructions often.
* Plan and compose your essay by structuring with the scratch paper.
* Leave a few minutes at the end of each essay to look for mistakes and gramatical errors.

## Verbal and Quantitative Reasoning

Question types:

* Single choice.
* Multiple choice.
* Written numerical.

A calculator is provided for the quantitative portion.

Incorrect answers do not count against your score. Because of this, it is important that you answer all questions for the best score possible. 

Do not spend too much time on a single question that is difficult or unfamiliar. Come back later. Focus on the questions you can answer now. You can only work on a single section, but you can navigate through all questions. All questons are worth the same.

Use scratch paper for your own advantage.
